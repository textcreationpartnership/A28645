            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I Bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom the whole Family of Heaven and Earth is named, That he would grant you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with might by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith, that ye be rooted and grounded
<pb facs="tcp:44737:8"/>love, may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height: and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God,</hi> Eph: <hi>3.14. to the 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Paul the Apoſtle, the Veſſel of eternall Election, the Treaſury of divine San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, the Mirrour and Example of heavenly contemplation in his former words ſheweth us, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, Object, and Fruit of mentall Exerciſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:44737:8"/>
            <p>For mentall Exerciſe, to the end it may become pious and wholſome, it is neceſſary that it have a power ſupernaturally ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening, a wiſdom regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and a clemency com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, let therefore the devout Soul, inflamed with the love of divine contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, bow the knees of her mind before the Throne of the moſt bleſſed and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Trinity, let her humbly knock and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly deſire,</p>
            <p>The ſtrengthening power of God the Father, leſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with labour ſhe be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:44737:9"/>
            <p>The directing Wiſdome of God the Son, leſt ſeduced with error, ſhe wander from the truth.</p>
            <p>The comforting Piety and Clemency of the Holy Ghoſt, leſt overcome with weariſomneſs ſhe faint.</p>
            <p>For every good thing that is given, and every gift that is perfect, is from above, deſcending from the Father of lights, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> all our good is either God, or from God, he therefore in the beginning of every good worke is fit to be implored, from whom originally every
<pb facs="tcp:44737:9"/>good thing proceedeth, by whom every good thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarly is produced, and to whom every good thing finally is addreſſed.</p>
            <p>This is that ineffable Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of when he ſaith. I bow my knees &amp;c. unto that place. That ye may be able.</p>
            <p>Secondly he ſheweth the Object of this wholſome mentall Exerciſe. The Object truly of the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a devout mind is ſaid to be internall, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſuperior and inferior.</p>

                  <p>O My Soul, (according to S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) let thy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration begin with thy ſelfe, leſt in vaine thou ſearch into other things, thy ſelfe being neglected. <hi>[Idem,]</hi> Many men knew many things, and know not themſelves, they look into others and forſake themſelves, ſeeking God by thoſe things that are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, leaving their internall, in whom God is interior. Wherefore I will return from the externall to the internal, and from the internall I will aſcend to the ſupernall, that I may know from whence I came, or whither I go; from whence I am, or what I am; and ſo by the knowledge of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44737:16"/>my ſelfe, I may aſcend to the knowledge of God. In like manner S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon S. <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith, That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans ſelf is not the leaſt part of Philoſophy.

                  <p>Know thy ſelf O man, what thou art, look that thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what enters into thee in thy thought, what paſſeth from thee in thy diſcourſe. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy life therefore, O my Soul, by a daily diſcuſſion, conſider diligently, how much thou profiteſt, how much thou art deficient, what thou art in manners, what thou art in affection, how like or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, how near or far off thou art to God. Ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this, that it is much more commendable and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44737:16"/>for thee, if thou knoweſt thy ſelf, then if (thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected) thou knoweſt the courſe of the Stars, the vertues of Hearbs, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of Men, the natures of living creatures, hadſt the knowledge of all heavenly &amp; earthly things. Render ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy ſelfe to thy ſelfe, and if not alwaies, yet at leaſt ſometimes. Govern thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, direct thy actions, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thy waies. Therefore O my Soul, keep the Councels of holy men, and firſt of all convert the raies of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation to the Eaſt region, (that is to ſay) to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of thy own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Diligently therefore conſider how nobly thou art made of God by nature, how vitiouſly by thy own will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44737:17"/>thou art deformed through ſin, how gratiouſly by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs thou art often reformed by Grace.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therfore conſider how nobly thou art formed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thy naturall nobility, as I conceive, conſiſts in this, becauſe that there is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in thee naturally to beautifie thee, the image of the moſt bleſſed Trinity. whereupon S. <hi>Anſelm</hi> in his <hi>Proſologie</hi> ſaith: I confeſs O Lord, and give thee thanks, becauſe thou haſt created me according to thy own image, that I might be mindfull of thee, think of thee, and love thee.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> According to the interior man, three things I find in me, by which I call to mind, behold and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44737:17"/>deſire God. Theſe three are, Memory, Underſtanding, and Will. For when I am mindfull of God, in him alſo I am delighted, for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of him is upon one, when with my underſtanding I behold him how much in himſelfe he is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, becauſe he is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of all things.</p>
                  <p>In Angels deſirable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſire to behold him.</p>
                  <p>In all his Saints delectable, foraſmuch as continually (they being happy) do rejoice in him.</p>
                  <p>In all his Creatures admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe he powerfully createth, wiſely governeth, bountifully diſpenſeth all things.</p>
                  <p>When I look into theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44737:18"/>things, him alſo I deſire. When I love God by my will, I transform my ſelfe into him. For this is the power or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of love that it maketh thee to be like unto that which thou loveſt. <hi>Theſe S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Re-acknowledge therefore O my ſoule, how wonderfull and ineſtimable a dignity it is, not only to be a mark of the Creator, which is common to all creatures, but to be the very Image of him, which is only proper to a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature. Praiſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. O my ſoule, our Lord; praiſe thy God O Sion.</p>
                  <p>Awake and praiſe, rejoice and be glad, becauſe thou art adorned with the image of God, made comely with his ſimilitude, partaker or reaſon,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44737:18"/>capable of eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe theſe things perhaps not unworthily may be judged meane, if they ſhould end with death, exult and praiſe, becauſe beſide the aforeſaid he hath beſtowed on thee an immortall nature, an incorruptible ſubſtance, an interminable durance, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual life. For thou ſhouldſt not be the Image of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Trinity, if thou couldſt be ſhut up within the bounds of death. <hi>S. Aug. of the city of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my ſoule conſider that thy Creator after this being, hath geven thee a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall being, after this he hath given thee power to live, to perceive, to diſcern; he hath adorned thee with ſenſes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44737:19"/>he hath enlightened thee with wiſdom. Attend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy comlineſs, that thou maiſt underſtand, what beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thou oughteſt to love in thy ſelfe, which if thou be not ſufficient to contemplate thy ſelfe, as it befits thee, why then at leaſt doſt thou not weigh and conſider by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans judgement, what thou oughteſt to eſteem of thy ſelf? Thou haſt a Spouſe, of whoſe beautie (if thou didſt not doubt) thou wouldſt know, that ſo fair, ſo comly, ſo only a Son of God would not be raviſhed with thy countenance, if a ſingular comlineſs, and above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be admired did not invite him. <hi>Theſe S.

Behold what the Bridegroom ſaith: I (ſaith he) and my Father will come unto him, and will make a manſion with him. And in another place in the Goſpel, <hi>Zacheus</hi> make haſte to come down, becauſe to day it behoveth me to ſtay in thy houſe. For to inſinuate into the mind is only poſſible to him that created it. For he it is who being more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in thy thoughts, doth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44737:20"/>give himſelfe to thee, as S. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith. Rejoice the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O happie ſoul, that thou canſt be an entertainer of ſuch a Gueſt, <hi>S.

So that the Heavens cannot deny her a reſting place in Heaven, who hath prepared for himſelfe a reſt in this life.</p>
                  <p>O my ſoule, thou art too covetous, if the preſence of ſuch a Gueſt cannot content

                  <p>But if yet theſe do not move thee to praiſe thy Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, convert the light of thy contemplation to the fourth benefit, and know, that thy palace is of ſuch a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that no creature is ſufficient to ſatisfie thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, <hi>Hugo de Sancto Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore.</hi>

                  <p>Now as I thinke, O my Soul, thou haſt ſufficiently ſeen thy Nobility, which is very laudable. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert now the light of contemplation to thy power,

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44737:22"/>that it may ſerve for they profits, and that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually offer it it ſelfe to thy pleaſures, according to the diſtribution of times. See now, O my Soule, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſider, that the Creator thy Spouſe and friend hath ordained the whole Fabricke of the world for thy ſervice. Behold, the Angels doe cſeanſe and inflame thy affection, illuminate and inform thy Intellect, doe perfect, and keepe thy bodie. It is a great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to have ſuch Doctors, Comforters, and ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers.

                  <p>The Heaven ſeeks to pleaſe thee by his motion, the lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries by their influence, the Sun gives the day the Moon lights the night, the fire tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers the coldneſs of the Aire, the Aire mitigates for thee, the internall heat of fire, the water cleanſeth thy foulneſs cooleth the heat of thy thirſt, and doth fructifie the Earth, The Earrh likewiſe doth beare thee with his ſolidity, recreate thee with his ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, delight thee with his pleaſantneſs.

Alas! alas! miſerable man that J have imprinted the Image of the Devill on the Jmage of God, why have J not hated the imitation of him, whoſe name J do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre? He hath fallen of his own accord, J willingly have gone aſtray.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44737:47"/>is wiped away by the bath of contrition, by ſo much the clearer the benefit of divine reparation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
                  <p>For (according to Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) ſinne is a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereby the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is dulled, and the whole inferiour man is overcloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wherefore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that by ſo much more carefully the mentall Eyes are to be continually clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the darkneſs of ſin, by the tears of compunction, by how much the more the light of contemplation is darkened thereby.</p>
                  <p>Therefore now, O my ſoule, being purified in thy affections, direct the light of contemplation to behold, how by the profound clemency of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44737:48"/>God, how by the high wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, how by the wonderfull power of God, thou art reformed by Grace.</p>
                  <p>Firſt conſider, how by the benefit of Redemption, he hath freed thee from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, knoweſt thou not that by originall ſinne, thou wert robbed of all naturall and ſpirituall guifts, brought into ſubjection by the power of the Prince of Darkneſſe, repulſed and exiled from thy Country?</p>
                  <p>But (according to Saint <hi>Bern.</hi>) that ſingular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty, would dye, that we might live, ſerve that we might raigne, be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that we might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to our Country, and he hath ſubjected himſele to all baſe works, that he might
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44737:48"/>place us above all his works. For the ſonne of man came to ſeek and ſave what had been loſt, I ſay, that he might humble thee being proud.</p>
                  <p>For this the only Son of God,
<note place="margin">St. Greg. in his Regiſter.</note> hath taken upon him our infirmity, for this he being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, hath made himſelfe, not only viſible, but alſo hath appeared deſpiſed, for this he hath ſuffered ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reproches, contemptible deriſions, tormenting paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he an humble God might teach man that he ought not to be proud. God hath deſpiſed all earthly Goods,

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44737:49"/>earthly evills, that he might teach us how to beare them; ſo that Felicity ought not to be ſought in the one, nor Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity be feared in the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he came,
<note place="margin">Saint Aug.</note> that he might recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile thee to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When thou wert an enemy to the Father I have reconciled thee, when thou wert afarre of, I came that I might reduce thee, when thou wanderdſt among Mountains and deſarts, I have ſought thee. Amongſt Rocks and Woods I found thee, upon my Shoulders I have carryed thee, I have reſtored thee to my Father, I have laboured, I have ſwet, I have expoſed my head to Thornes, my hands to Nailes, I have ſuffered my

                  <p>Thirdly he came, that being ſould,
<note place="margin">Saint Aug.</note> he might redeeme thee. Let us admire, give thanks, love, praiſe, adore. becauſe we are called by the death of our Redeemer, from death to life, from darkneſs to light, from exile to our Country, from Corruption to incorruption, from miſery to Glory, from lamentation to joy.

                  <p>See now, O my Soule, and

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44737:79"/>carnall delights, and for this only thou unwillingly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the World, yet conſider that all theſe are but fraile and tranſitory. Tell me where are the <hi>Monarchs?</hi> where the Princes? where thoſe Lovers formerly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of? I am afraid that moſt of them alas are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done and gone to Hell. What doth Pride now profit them? what the vaunting of riches? For he that loveth the world more then God, his life better then a Cloyſter, Gluttony better then abſtinence, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry better then Continency, follows Satan and ſhall go with him to eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They that floriſh with the felicity of this World,
<note place="margin">St. Aug.</note> do periſh by the power of God: they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44737:80"/>floriſh for a time and periſh eternally, they floriſh with deceitfull goods, but are really tormented.</p>
                  <p>If it delight us to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in this World, let us with a ready will get into the favour of him, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth all things, and in him we ſhall have whatſoever we happily and holily deſire. For wealth harmeth nor the rich man, if he uſe it well, nor doth poverty make the poore man commendable, if in his poverty he taketh not heed of the filth of ſinne.</p>

Wherefore (according to Saint <hi>Bern.</hi>) It likewiſe behoveth thee that thou be delighted either in the higheſt things or the loweſt. Therefore (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſome, which neglect their own life, whilſt they deſire tranſitory things

And when nothing can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice their affections without God, they repoſe in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemplation of their maker, deſiring to be preſent with the Heavenly Citizens, and yet being placed in the VVorld, they riſe above the

                  <p>O My Soule, I conſider that worldly Joy (if tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be termed a joy and not rather an unknowne ſcourge) is never truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,, but when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſpiſed. Wherefore as it is related by the true contemners of the World, Worldly joy is moſt eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held contemptible for five things. Firſt becauſe it hath a baſeneſs in it's object? For what is the joy of the world? Saint <hi>Aug.</hi> anſwereth, an unpuniſhed wickedneſs, that is to ſay, to be inebriated with Luxury, wholly to be buſied in Banquetings, to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44737:84"/>continue in vanities, and to ſuffer no evill in this life for theſe things. For evill people think themſelves to be in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, when they are not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for their wickedneſſe. And they know not, that there is nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy then the happineſs of Sinners, whereby penall infirmity is nouriſhed, and an evill will is ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2: It hath impurity in its ſubject. For the ſoule defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſinnes, is the ſubject of worldly joy, which glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth when it ſhall do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and rejoyceth in the worſt things. Wherefore Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith well; That to laugh and rejoyce with this world, is not the Act of an underſtanding man, but of a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44737:84"/>mad man. Truly O my Soule, a cleane heart is not glad and jocund with this uncleane world, but with God and in God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It hath a ſhortneſs in it ſelfe, becauſe the joy of an Hypocrite is like a minute. The world is this Hypocrite, whoſe joy is like a point, which is neither broad nor long, nor high nor low. The joy of the world is a vanity,

                     </note> which with a great deſire is hoped for, that it may come and when it doth come, it cannot be ſtayed. O my ſoule how ſhort, how fraile and how tranſitory is worldly joy. For ſhort are the dayes of Man as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They have ſorrow in

Yea O my ſoule, if thou be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, ſuch joy hath alwayes ſorrow mixt with it, becauſe ever of neceſſity the Guilty Conſcience feareth cruell things. Art thou ignorant, O my ſoule, that the joy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth no longer, which is in eating and drinking; then the ſorrow continueth which is a hungring and thirſting.

In the firſt this Heavenly ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſmelled, in the ſecond is is taſted, and in the third ſomtimes even to inebriation it is taken and ſwallowed up.</p>
                  <p>Firſt I ſay, thou oughteſt to be cleanſed from ſins, from inordinate affections, from temporall conſolation, and from the inordinate love of Creatures; becauſe (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>Bernard</hi>) he erreth altogether that beleiveth that he is able to mixe the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall ſweetneſs with this duſt,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44737:93"/>that divine Balſom with this venemous Joy, thoſe Graces of the Holy Ghoſt with the Allurements of this world. But after the Soule ſhall bee purged by ſuch things, cleanſed from tear-diſtilling grones, and purifyed by ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull ſobbings, becauſe as St. <hi>Aug</hi> ſaith, it is convenient that that mind ſhould always find ſorrow in it ſelf, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking his Creator, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſeek joyes in himſelfe, and in the Creature.</p>
                  <p>Excellently therfore St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Morals ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of that Sentence of <hi>Job.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44737:94"/>not humiliate himſelf in this Exile by the bewailing of Heavenly deſires, cannot taſt the joyes of the eternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For they are barren of the food of Truth, who are delighted in the ſcarcity of this Peregrination.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The mind ought to be exerciſed in the acting of good things, and in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of evil. <hi>Bleſsed are they that mourne, for they ſhall bee comforted.</hi> Becauſe thoſe whom the love of truth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to affection, the refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of Conſolation feedeth. St. <hi>Bernard;</hi> O good Jeſus how often after innumerable tears and groans, haſt thou annointed my wounded Soul with the Oyntment of thy merey, and ſomtimes almoſt deſpairing haſt received me,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44737:94"/>and being comforted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of mercy haſt utterly left me? Behold in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the reward of good things is in it ſelf, wherfore truly though in the beginning the way be ſtraight which lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to life, yet in proceſs of time, it is enlarged with the ſweetneſs of ineſtimable love. O how bleſſed therfore is the conſolation which divinely is infuſed into them that ſuffer for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The third thing wherein the Soule is inebriated with this ſweetneſs is the elevation of the mind, when happily the Soul is drawn form earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, and after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain wonderfull manner is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated above it ſelf, above the world, yea, above every Creature, that now the Soul

                  <p>Thou therefore, O my Soule, the Daughter of the Eternall King, hear with a devout mind, and incline thy Eare to holy and health-bringing councells.

                  <p>O my Soul, With how great Joy thinkeſt thou do they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoice, when they perceiue ſo many to be overcome of the fleſh, the world and the devill, ſo many to be defiled with ſuch diverſity of ſins of which they ſhall never obtain pardon, ſo many without end, eternally to be damned: Truly then I beleive to have paſſed from death to life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubleth the joy of life.</p>
                  <p>O Lord God, if the danger in war be now ſo greivous, how great ſhall the joy be in Triumph, when after the world is overcome and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanquiſhed, wicked <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi>

                  <p>All the Earth is full of his Glory, who hath called us from the miſery of the world to the joyes of the celeſtiall Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>O my Soule, what a one ſhall that day be unto thee, when thou ſhalt be aſſumed into this quier, when all thy torments, if thou ſhalt live well, if thou wilt patiently ſuffer, ſhalbe converted into Eternall Jubiſee? Then thou ſhalt praiſe with exultation the Lord thy God for all theſe things, ſaying, I will ſing the mercies of our Lord for ever. Then which Song according to Saint <hi>Aug.</hi> that is fung to the praiſe of the glory of Chriſt, by
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44737:125"/>whoſe precious blood wee are delivered, nothing ſhall be more pleaſant to that City, nothing more ſweet.</p>
                  <p>Thou therefore when thou art tryed with Temptations, when thou art overcom with Perſecutions, and when thou art moleſted in this World with divers Tribulations, then mentally fly into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and conſider that this is no other thing but the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of eternall joy, and then the conſideration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, leſſeneth the violence of the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>If we would conſider what and how great the Rewards are, which are promiſed us in Heaven, all things on Earth would ſeem vile in our mind and truly not only the goods which delightfully we poſſeſſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44737:125"/>but alſo the evills which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably wee ſuſtain. The troubles of this world are not equivalent to the fault paſt which is forgiven, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Grace which is beſtowed and for the future glory which is promiſed, which thou then O my Soul, with joy ſhalt poſſeſs when thou perfectly underſtandeſt, that thou haſt lived in the world with ſo great danger, wherewith the moſt are oppreſſed, that thou haſt overcome the deceitfull wiles of Satan, wherewith many are deceived, that thou haſt eſcaped the eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are afflicted.</p>

And here thou ougheſt to conſider, in what manner he ſuffered, being cloathed in thy forme or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For he ſuffered like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a true Lamb, moſt freely in reſpect of himſelf, moſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in reſpect of his Father, moſt wiſely in reſpect of his Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Study therefore to put on the habit, according to the repreſentation of that forme he put on, to wit, of Bounty, Severity, Humility, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledg or Proſpicacity And this is the fourth Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>

               <head>The ſixth Bundle. Of the ſeven Seals opened by the paſſion of Chriſt.</head>
               <p>THE Paſſion of Chriſt doth not only reform the memory by devout Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor only inflame the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires unto Devotion, but moreover principally illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the underſtanding, and leads it to the knowledge of Truth. Even as in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the whol frame of the World, there were ſeven
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:44737:170"/>things ſhut up before the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt which now are opened.</p>
               <p>The firſt Seal was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Excellency of the Godhead, who by the Croſs hath manifeſted himſelf to be the cheif wiſdom, in that, that he hath deſtroyed the Devill with the great Juſtice, in as much as hee hath payd the price of our Redemption, the greateſt mercy, becauſe hee hath given his Son for us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Seal, was the intelligible Spirit, which is manifeſted by his Suffering, of how great bounty hee is in reſpect of the Angels who permitted Chriſt to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, of how great dignity in reſpect of men, for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of them, Chriſt was crucified; of how great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:44737:171"/>in reſpect of the Devills who cauſed their Lord God to be crucified.</p>
               <p>The third Seal, is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World, which by the death of Chriſt, is prooved to bee a place of Darkneſſe wherein Blindneſſe raigneth, becauſe it knew not the true Light, wherein barrenneſſe raigneth, becauſe it reputed Chriſt as unprofitable, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and wickedneſſe, in that it condemned the Innocent.</p>
               <p>The fourth Seale was Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, which by the Croſs appeareth to be a place of Glory, of Gladneſs and of plenty therein, in reſpect that Chriſt for the reſtitution thereof, is made vile poor and miſerable.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, by the Death of Chriſt, Hell is manifeſted to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:44737:171"/>be full of all penury, viſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and poverty, becauſe he hath ſuffered theſe things for the exterminating of ſinne, much more the damned ſhall ſuffer theſe, for the juſt retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of works.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Seale, was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>audable virtue, by which the Croſs of Chriſt, is prooved to be pretious, beautifull, and profitable; precious, becauſe Chriſt would looſe his corporall life, before that he would contradict vertue; Beautifull, becauſe he ſhined much in his very reproaches, profitable, becauſe one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect act of Chriſts virtue ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked Hell, opened Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, reſtored that which was loſt.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Seale is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Croſs, and therin
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:44737:172"/>appeared, how deteſtable the culpable guiltineſs is, when for the Remiſſion thereof it needed ſo great a price, ſo grand a Sacrifice, ſo difficult a medicine.</p>

               <p>AND the third day, Chriſt the Conquerour of death riſe again, and ſhewed how that we are to riſe again al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. If therefore thou haſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with Chriſt ſuffering, now rejoice with him riſing again, conſider devoutly in what manner the Soule of Chriſt deſcended into Hell, what it did there, and of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:44737:172"/>joy of the holy Fathers, and of the Sorrow of the Devils. Think of the fear of the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, thinke of the watching of the Angells about the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, how one only now is reported to fit and then to ſtand upon the ſtone, now in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, then two, and theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, whereby is ſhown the multitude of Angels about the Sepulchre, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall uiſitations of the women. Think how Love and Deſire conſtrained <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and other weomen, often to run and to viſit the Sepulchre of our Lord, thinke upon the divers apparitions of Chriſt. Think upon the ſweet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of him with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Conſider, why Chriſt would appear in <hi>Galilee,</hi> but
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:44737:173"/>that thou oughteſt to fly from vices, whereupon the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over is called a paſſing over. But in <hi>Galilee,</hi> that is in the tranſmigration and change of our bodies, we ſhall behold and ſee Chriſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven after the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Forty daies after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Chriſt aſcending on high, lead the Captivity of the holy Fathers captive. Meditate on the glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of them that aſcended with Chriſt: for the Saints followed him, the Angels came to meet him, and then they did frame thoſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions among themſelves, whereof the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: who is this that cometh? &amp;c. Think of the ſorrow of the Apoſtles, and the joy of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:44737:173"/>the Angels. Think how the Angels returned to comfort the Apoſtles. Learn thou to aſcend to Chriſt, but let it be by the aſcendings before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, that thou maieſt here leave vice; becauſe no vice aſcendeth with our Saviour, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>After that, our Lord ſent from Heaven the Holy Ghoſt in fiery tongues. See and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how the Apoſtles were afterwards comforted and grounded in Charity. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate why the Holy Ghoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in fire, why in tongues, why in both together, and why in the forme of other Creatures, and ſtudy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in thy ſelfe the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch things. Conſider the effects and gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and many other ſuch

            <p>That thou mayeſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in vertues it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for thee to have ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exerciſes wherewith thou mayeſt employ thy mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unleſſe thou doſt ſo thou canſt not perſevere in vertues.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore thou ſhalt exerciſe thy ſelfe in Prayer after this manner and feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at theſe times.</p>
            <p>Before the beginning of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very work or Act thou ſhalt cal upon our Lord, and ſhalt pray a little with ſome ſuch ſhort Prayer. O God make haſt to help me. Have mercy on me O God, or the like. Alſo whenſoever thou heareſt the Bell to toule, thou ſhalt pray, or when thou heareſt it to ſtrike the houres, fervently thou ſhalt make ſecretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy ſelfe theſe Prayers, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:44737:175"/>thou ſhalt do it ſo, that though thou be nere unto others, they ſhall not perceive that thou prayeſt.</p>
            <p>Thy ſecond Exerciſe ſhall be this, to wit, that thou ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly determine whenſoever thou heareſt the Bell toule generally to amend thy ſelfe, and pray to God that thou mayeſt.</p>
            <p>Before thou beginneſt any notable work, thou ſhalt brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, how thou haſt determined to carry thy ſelfe in thy former purpoſe.</p>
            <p>In like manner every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou maiſt conſider how thou wouldeſt behave thy ſelf the whole day, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou doſt thy outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and when thou doſt any Act, thou ſhalt briefly weigh how thou haſt purpoſed.</p>

            <p>Alſo three or four times a day, thou muſt vehemently ſet thy ſelf againſt Pride.</p>

            <p>Thus therefore by purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Acting, I hope that thou wilt competently ſpend thy time.</p>
            <p>Thy fourth Excerciſe ſhall be, That thou dayly exerciſe thy ſelfe in humble and abject works, alwaies to chooſe the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:44737:177"/>loweſt place, and with all thy heart to deſpiſe thy ſelf, and to eſteem thy ſelfe unworthy any praiſe, but to aſcribe all to God, nor ſhalt thou care whether thou art praiſed or diſpraiſed. Be mindfull and look into thy ſelf, and thou ſhalt find, that thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any eſteeme, but moſt worthy of all Reproach: For when thou art neer unto others, thou art to carry thy ſelf ſilently, courteouſly, and modeſtly, yet ſo as it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thee.</p>
            <p>Thy fift Excerciſe ſhall be, that thou ſhunne all ſignes of Pride, to witt, clamour in ſpeech, and ſo of all other things.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Exerciſe ſhall
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:44737:177"/>be, that thou often conſider, wherein thou carrieſt thy ſelf evilly whereſoever thou ſhalt be and thou ſhalt not ſuffer any little vice paſſe over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Judgement, becauſe he that doth not weigh little faults falleth often into greater.</p>
            <p>The 7th. Exerciſe ſhall be, that chiefly whereſoever thou ſhalt be thou keep a Guard on thy Eyes: becauſe from the not looking to them, infinite miſcheifs and evills proceed. Therefore have an eſpeciall care unto thy Eyes.</p>
            <p>The 8th. Exerciſe is to conſider the good Actions of others and not the evill. For when thou ſeeſt or perceiveſt any one to ſinne thou ſhalt think that if he ſhould have ſo much Grace from God as
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:44737:178"/>thy ſelfe, much more fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would amend himſelfe then thou. And if thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveſt any one to do any good, thou ſhalt conſider how thou maiſt imitate that good.</p>
            <p>Thy 9th. Exerciſe ſhall be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all that thou ſeeſt and, heareſt from men that thou Conſter it to the beſt, and ſo thou ſhalt not be cenſured.</p>
            <p>Thy 10th. Exerciſe ſhall be, that alwayes whereſoever thou ſhalt be, thou maiſt carry thy ſelfe mannerly and decently in thy outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, leaſt thou maiſt give an ill example to others, becauſe the externall indecency is a ſigne of an indevout mind.</p>
            <p>Thy 11th. Exerciſe ſhall
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:44737:178"/>be, that alwayes whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou art, thou mayeſt take heed, that thou doſt not that thing, whereby thou maiſt give an ill example to any one, or wherein any may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret ill of thee, becauſe it is very dangerous to ſhew an ill example to others.</p>
            <p>The 12th. Exerciſe ſhall be couragiouſly to reſiſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to abſtaine and withdraw thy ſelfe from carnall concupiſcences: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in them there is no health.</p>
            <p>The laſt ſhall be, that thou maiſt alwayes ſtand in feare, and carry thy ſelfe modeſtly, and ſo keep thy ſelfe being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as when thou art with
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:44737:179"/>others. For God ſeeth all things which thou doſt.</p>
            <p>Thou ſhalt ſtudy to perform theſe Exerciſes commonly as much as in thee lyes, and thou ſhalt diligently entreat our Lord, that he will give thee grace to do them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without him thou canſt do nothing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I will returne from things externall to the Internall, and will aſcend from the internall to the ſupernall, that I may know from whence I come, or whither I goe, what I am, and from whence I am, that ſo from the knowledge of my ſelfe, I may be able to come to the knowledge of God.

From whence do I come, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exteriour man from thoſe Parents, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to be damned, before I was borne, they being ſinners have begotten me a ſinner in their ſinne, and in ſinne have nurſed me, what am I? A man of a ſlippery humour, for I am in a moment of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conceived of humane ſeed, moreover this Spume being coagulated by encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a little, is made fleſh; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, lamenting and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I am delivered to the exile of this World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now I waxing greater, am full of Iniquities. Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently I ſhall be preſented before the ſevere Judge
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:44737:180"/>Then it ſhall be ſaid of mee; behold the man and his works. Conſider thoſe things more ſeriouſly.</p>
